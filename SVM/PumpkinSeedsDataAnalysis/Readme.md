Environment:
- Dataset
  This example referes a good dataset of Pumpkin Seeds Feature Study. It helps to understand the classification feature and orientation of seed propeties and its        relations. Following is the link to Kaggle:
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/pumpkin-seeds-dataset
  
- install python package kaggle

- IDE: VSCode

Steps:
1. Data analysis and quality of data, statistical features of the data (Dataset Online)
2. Retrive data from given dataset and cache it in the development environment (1cachedataset.py)
3. Standerdize the data and understand the feature of pumpkin seeds (2featurePCA2D.py)
4. Understanding Principal Component Analysis (PCA) its need (3featurePCA3D.py)
5. Understanding Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different models and study performance and accuracy behavior(4svm.py)
